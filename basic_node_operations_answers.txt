1. Run the commands sort, wc and uniq on the commands.js file. Explain how they work and what the output was.

Sort shows the files lines sorted alphabetically, line by line. The lines are grouped together, with the most
indented lines starting at the top of the sort. wc shows the newline, word, and byte count for the file. Output
was 76 156 1740.  uniq shows lines that are not repeated in a file, it filters them out. Output was all file
lines displayed.


2. Using the pipe (|) connect at least two commands and run it on commands.js. Explain what the output was and
why the specific data was outputted.

cat bash.js | wc
Displays the line, word, byte count of the file contents. Running wc bash.js will show the same numbers. This is
because the cat command outputs the contents of the bash file, then pipes it to the wc command. Similarly,
echo bash.js | wc shows the word, line, and byte count of the string 'bash.js'.



6.

function reverseString(inputString) {

  var splitString = inputString.split("").reverse().join("").split(" ");

  var reversedString = splitString.reverse().join(" ");

  console.log(reversedString);

}
